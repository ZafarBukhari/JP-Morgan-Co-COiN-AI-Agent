## Step 2: Research Deep

### Question 1: What Was the Problem?
Legal teams and loan officers were spending **360,000 hours annually** manually reviewing commercial credit agreements. This was costing the company millions in labor and slowing down the process of issuing loans to clients.

### Question 2: What Agent Did They Build?
They built **COiN (Contract Intelligence)**. The agent receives unstructured PDF/scanned legal documents as input. It then identifies patterns and outputs structured data points like renewal terms, obligations, and dates.

### Question 3: How Do Humans Stay in Control?
JPMorgan uses a **Human-in-the-loop** model. Humans monitor the agent's performance and approve the final data. If the AI encounters a clause it doesn't understand, it flags it for a human lawyer to review.

### Question 4: What Results Did They Get?
The bank reduced **360,000 hours of work to seconds**. This improved the speed of business significantly and virtually eliminated human errors caused by fatigue during long document reviews.

### Question 5: Why Did This Work?
Contract review is highly repetitive and follows specific legal logic, making it perfect for an AI agent. While the language is dense, the patterns are consistent. This workflow could easily be applied to insurance, real estate, and healthcare.
